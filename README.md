# AeroPrompt Lite (MVP)

A mobile-first web app (PWA-style) that acts like a friendly go/no-go coach.
This **Lite** version is built for speed and minimal cost: it can auto-fill conditions using METAR/TAF (and you can override anything) so you can validate the idea with real pilots immediately.

## What you need (free)
- A computer (Windows/Mac)
- Node.js 18+ installed

## Run locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Then open http://localhost:3000

## Next upgrades (when you're ready)
- Auto-fill METAR/TAF by ICAO (included)
- Real accounts + sync history (Supabase)
- Push notifications (currency reminders)
- App Store packaging (Expo / React Native wrapper)

## Disclaimer
Advisory only. Not for flight planning.
